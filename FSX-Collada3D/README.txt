Despite its name, this software is not a full-collada compliant converter.
In fact it focus only Google Sketchup exported files and only support a limited
set of collada features.

they are found within FSX SDK installation path :
xtomdl : Environment Kit/Modeling SDK/FSX_GmaxGamePack/plugins/XToMdl.exe
imagetool: Environment Kit/Terrain SDK/ImageTool.exe
