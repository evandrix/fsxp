<h2>Overview</h2></a>
<p>
</p><ul>
  <li> Every class is part of some <em>package</em>.
  <p>
  </p></li><li> All classes in a file are part of the same package.
  <p>
  </p></li><li> You can specify the package using a <em>package declaration</em>:
    <ul>
      package <i>name</i> ;
    </ul>
       as the first (non-comment) line in the file.
  <p>
  </p></li><li> Multiple files can specify the same package name.
  <p>
  </p></li><li> If no package is specified, the classes in the file go into a
       special unnamed package (the same unnamed package for all files).
  <p>
  </p></li><li> If package <i>name</i> is specified, the file must be in a subdirectory
       called <i>name</i> (i.e., the directory name must match the package
       name).
  <p>
  </p></li><li> You can access public classes in another (named) package using:
    <ul>
      <i>package-name.class-name</i>
    </ul>
       You can access the public fields and methods of such classes using:
    <ul>
      <i>package-name.class-name.field-or-method-name</i>
    </ul>
      You can avoid having to include the <i>package-name</i> using:
    <ul>
      import <i>package-name</i>.*;
    </ul>
    or
    <ul>
      import <i>package-name.class-name</i>;
    </ul>
    at the beginning of the file (after the package declaration).
    The former imports all of the classes in the package, and the second
    imports just the named class.  You must still use:
    <ul>
      <i>class-name</i>
    </ul>
    to access the classes in the packages, and
    <ul>
      <i>class-name.field-or-method-name</i>
    </ul>
    to access the fields and methods of the class; the only thing you can
    leave off is the package name.
</li></ul>

<a name="examples">
<h2>Examples</h2></a>
<p>
Assume that you are working in a directory called Javadir, and that you
create four files, whose contents are shown below.
</p><pre><u>file 1</u>
package ListPkg;
public class List { ... }
class ListNode {...}

<u>file 2</u>
package ListPkg;
public class NoNextItemException { ... }

<a name="file3">
<u>file 3</u></a>
public class Test { ... }
class Utils { ... }

<u>file 4</u>
class Test2 { ... }
</pre>

Here are the directories and file names you must use:
<ul>
  <li> File 1 must be in a subdirectory named ListPkg, in a file named
       List.java.
  </li><li> File 2 must also be in the ListPkg subdirectory, in a file named
       NoNextItemException.java.
  </li><li> File 3 must be in a file named Test.java (in the Javadir directory).
  </li><li> File 4 can be in any .java file (in the Javadir directory).
</li></ul>

<p>
And here are the classes that can be accessed by the code in each file:
</p><ul>
  <li> Files 1 and 2:
  <ul>
    <li> The code in the first two files (ListPkg/List.java and
         ListPkg/NoNextItemException.java) can access the classes
         defined in the same package (List, ListNode, and NoNextItemException).
         (No access was specified for those classes, so they get
         the default, package access.)
  
    <p>
    </p></li><li> The code in files 1 and 2 <em>cannot</em> access class Test, even
         though it is a public class.  The problem is that Test is in an
         unnamed package, so the code in the ListPkg package has no way to
         import that package, or to name class Test.
  
    <p>
    </p></li><li> The code in files 1 and 2 <em>cannot</em> access classes Utils and
         Test2, because they have default (package) access, and are in a 
         different package.
  
  </li></ul>
  <p>
  </p></li><li> Files 3 and 4:
    <ul>
      <li> The code in file 3 (Test.java) can access classes ListPkg.List,
         ListPkg.NoNextItemException, Test, Utils, and Test2 (the first two
         because they are public classes in a named package, and the last
         three because they are in the same, unnamed package, and have either
         public or package access).  Note however, that if the code in
	 Test.java uses the class Test2, and that class is <em>not</em> in a
	 file called Test2.java, then the file that contains class Test2
	 must be compiled first, or else the class will not be found.
  
    <p>
    </p></li><li> The code in file 4 (the file that contains class Test2) can access
         the same classes as the code in file 3 (Test.java).
  </li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>
Here's a summary of the example:
<table border="1" cols="3" width="100%">
<tbody><tr><td><em>File Contents  </em></td><td><em>Directory/FileName  </em></td><td><em>Can Access</em>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<pre>package ListPkg;
  public class List {...}
  class ListNode {...}
</pre>  </td><td>ListPkg/List.java  </td><td>List, ListNode, NoNextItemException
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<pre>package ListPkg;
  public class NoNextItemException
  {...}
</pre>  </td><td>ListPkg/NoNextItemException.java  </td><td>List, ListNode, NoNextItemException
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<pre>public class Test {...}
class Utils {...}
</pre>  </td><td>Test.java  </td><td>ListPkg.List, ListPkg.NoNextItemException, Test, Utils, Test2
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<pre>class Test2 {...}
</pre>  </td><td>any-name.java  </td><td>ListPkg.List, ListPkg.NoNextItemException, Test, Utils, Test2
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2>How the Java Compiler Finds Files</h2></a>
</p><p>
When you compile a file that uses a class (or interface) that is not defined
in the same file, the Java compiler uses
</p><ul>
  <li> the name of the class
  </li><li> the names of imported packages (if any)
  </li><li> the name of the current package
</li></ul>
to try to locate the class definition.  For example, assume that you are
working in directory Javadir, which contains one file named Test.java:
<ul><pre>import ListPkg.*;

public class Test {
    List L;
    ... 
}
</pre></ul>
Since List is not defined in Test.Java, and since there is no file
List.java in the current directory, the compiler will look for List.java
in the ListPkg subdirectory (since Test.java imports the ListPkg
package).
<p>
Now suppose that the ListPkg subdirectory contains two files: List.java
and ListNode.java, both part of the ListPkg package.  Also
assume that List.java uses the ListNode class defined in ListNode.java.
If you try to compile just List.java in the ListPkg subdirectory, you
will get an error, because the compiler will try to find the file
ListNode.java in a "ListPkg" subdirectory of the current directory,
rather than looking in the current directory itself.
</p><p>
There are (at least) three ways to solve this problem:
</p><ol>
  <li>Always compile a package from the <em>parent</em> directory.
      For example, compile List.java from Javadir, rather than from
      Javadir/ListPkg; in the Javadir directory, type:
      <ul>
      javac ListPkg/List.java
      </ul>
  </li><li>Always compile <em>all</em> files in a package at the same time;
      for example, in the directory Javadir/ListPkg type:
      <ul>
      javac *.java
      </ul>
  </li><li>Make a circular link from the package subdirectory to itself;
      for example, in the directory Javadir/ListPkg type:
      <ul>
      ln -s . ListPkg
      </ul>
</li></ol>


<p>
<a name="classpath">
<h2>The CLASSPATH Environment Variable</h2></a>

</p><p>
To use a package that is not in a subdirectory of the current
directory (i.e., the directory in which you invoke javac), you must
set the environment variable CLASSPATH to tell the java compiler where
to look.

</p><p>
For example, if there were a List package in
<i>/p/course/cs368-horwitz/public/ListPkg</i>,
you would set CLASSPATH like this:
</p><pre>  setenv CLASSPATH .:/p/course/cs368-horwitz/public
</pre>
Including the dot and the colon before the directory tells the compiler
also to look in the directory in which the compile is being done.
Note that you should set the CLASSPATH variable to the <em>parent</em>
of the "ListPkg" subdirectory, not to the ListPkg subdirectory itself.
