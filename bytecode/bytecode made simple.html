<h1>Javassist: Java Bytecode Engineering Made Simple</h1>


<div class="storybody">

  

  
  <p>Javassist is a powerful new
library in the field of bytecode engineering. It allows developers to
add a new method to a compiled class, modify a method body, and so
forth. Unlike other similar libraries, Javassist enables this without
knowledge of Java bytecode or the structure of a class file. </p><p>Bytecode engineering is used to manipulate and modify compiled
Java classes and to programmatically create new classes. This
engineering can happen either at runtime or at compile time. Some
technologies use bytecode manipulation to optimize or enhance existing
Java classes. Other technologies use it to make themselves easier to
use or to avoid cumbersome code generators. For instance, the JDO 1.0
(Java Data Objects) specification requires bytecode enhancement of
precompiled Java to add database persistence code to simple Java
classes. In Aspect-Oriented Programming, some of the new frameworks use
bytecode engineering to enhance Java classes with cross-cutting
functionality. EJB containers, like JBoss, dramatically speed up the
development cycle by dynamically creating Java classes at runtime to
avoid the costly code generation/precompilation step required by EJBs.
Even the JDK does bytecode manipulation within its
java.lang.reflect.Proxy class. </p><p>Bytecode manipulation has been a complex and often
unacceptable task for framework developers because of the huge
implementation costs. Learning bytecode is very similar to learning an
assembly language. The learning curve can be very steep for developers.
Not only that but code written to engineer bytecode is a challenge to
maintain, as it's difficult to read and follow. Javassist is a library
for simplifying bytecode manipulation. It allows developers to fully
exploit bytecode manipulation with little or no knowledge of bytecode,
giving them a degree of fine-grained control. </p><p><strong>API Parallel to the Reflection API</strong><br>The
first part of the Javassist API is similar to the Java Reflection API.
It allows you to view the structure of a Java class before it is loaded
by the ClassLoader. It includes CtClass, CtMethod, and CtField classes
as the Reflection API does java.lang.Class, java.lang.reflect.Method,
and Field. These classes represent a class, a method, and a field that
have not been loaded yet. They provide a number of methods parallel to
the Reflection API, for example, getName, getSuperclass, getMethods,
getSignature, and so on. The following code reads
org.geometry.Point.class, analyzes the definition, and prints the name
of the super class (in this article, we always assume that the
javassist.* packages are imported): </p><p><font color="#800000">1. ClassPool pool = ClassPool.getDefault();<br>2. CtClass pt = pool.get("org.geometry.Point");<br>3. System.out.println(pt.getSuperclass().getName()); </font>
</p><p>The ClassPool object is a factory of CtClass objects. It
searches for a class file in the specified class path and creates a
CtClass object as a singleton for each class. The get method in
ClassPool returns the CtClass object representing the class with the
given name. </p><p>The Javassist API does not provide methods for creating a new
instance (the newInstance method), invoking a method (the invoke
method), or accessing a field value (the get and set methods) since
CtClass objects represent classes that have not been loaded. On the
other hand, the API provides methods for changing class definitions.
For example, setSuperclass in CtClass changes the super class of the
class. The reflection API does not support such changes. For example: </p><p><font color="#800000">4. pt.setSuperclass(pool.get("Figure")); </font>
</p><p>This modifies the definition of the Point class so that it
extends the Figure class. For consistency, this example assumes that
the Figure class is compatible with the original super class. </p><p>Adding a new method to the Point class is also possible: 
</p><p><font color="#800000">5. CtMethod m = CtNewMethod.make("public int xmove(int dx) { x += dx; }", pt);<br>6. pt.addMethod(m); </font>
</p><p>The CtMethod object that represents the added method is created
from the given source text. Developers do not have to write a sequence
of virtual machine instructions by hand. Instead, Javassist compiles
the given source text in Java with a custom compiler included in
Javassist. </p><p>Finally, to reflect all the changes above, the writeFile method is called: 
</p><p><font color="#800000">7. pt.writeFile(); </font>
</p><p>The writeFile method in CtClass writes the modified definition
of the class to a class file. Javassist can work with a ClassLoader, as
we'll discuss later. </p><p>Javassist is not the first class library for writing a
bytecode translator. For example, Jakarta BCEL is a popular library for
bytecode engineering. However, you can't use Jakarta BCEL with
source-level vocabulary. If you add a new method to a compiled class,
you must specify a method body by a sequence of bytecode instructions.
On the other hand, Javassist allows you to specify it by source text as
shown above. </p><p><strong>Instrumenting a Method Body</strong><br>The
instrumentation of method bodies can also be described with
source-level vocabulary. Developers do not have to directly manipulate
virtual machine instructions. Although the range is limited, Javassist
enables various typical instrumentations. If developers need
fine-grained instrumentation that they cannot describe with
source-level vocabulary, they can use the low-level part of the
Javassist API, which is not described in this article. It's a similar
bytecode-level API to Jakarta BCEL. </p><p>The design of the Javassist API for instrumenting a method
body is based on the idea of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP).
Javassist allows the identification of some expressions, such as method
calls and field accesses, in a method body and then substitutes a code
fragment for the expression. </p><p>For example, Listing 1 first obtains a CtMethod object that
represents a draw method in the Screen class; then it searches the body
of the draw method for method calls to move in Point class. All the
occurrences of the method calls to move are replaced with the following
block statement: </p><p><font color="#800000">{ System.out.println("move"); $_ = $proceed($$); } </font>
</p><p>so that a message is printed out before a move is called. The statement, written in special syntax: 
</p><p><font color="#800000">$_ = $proceed($$); </font>
</p><p>executes the original method call with the original parameters. 
</p><p>The instrument method in CtMethod searches the method body and,
when it finds a method-call expression, calls the edit method on the
given ExprEditor object. The parameter to the edit method is a
Method-Call object representing the found expression. Since this object
provides methods for getting static properties of the expression, the
edit method first examines the name of the called method and, if the
method is moved in Point, it replaces the method-call expression with
the block statement printing a message. The block statement is compiled
into bytecode by Javassist before the replacement. </p><p><strong>Special Variables</strong><br>In the substituted
statement, several special variables beginning with $ are available.
For example, $_ represents the result value of the substituted
expression. $$ represents a list of the original parameters to the
method called in the replaced expression. $proceed represents the name
of the originally called method. Each parameter to the originally
called method is represented by $1, $2, $3,.... The target object of
the method call is represented by $0. These special variables are
useful when developers want to change some of the parameters. For
example, if the substituted block given to the replace method at line 8
was as follows: </p><p><font color="#800000">{ System.out.println("move"); $_ = $proceed($1, 0); } </font>
</p><p>then the second parameter to the move method would be zero. 
</p><p>Another special variable $args is an Object array containing all
the parameters to the originally called method. If the type of a
parameter is a primitive type, then the wrapper object containing that
parameter value is stored in the array. For example, if the parameter
is an int value, the java.lang.Integer object containing that int value
is stored in the array. $args is useful when the parameters are used to
call a method through the invoke method in java.lang. reflect.Method. </p><p>Javassist also allows the insertion of a code fragment at the
beginning or end of a method body. For example, the insertBefore method
inserts the given block statement at the beginning of the method body. </p><p><font color="#800000">1. ClassPool pool = ClassPool.getDefault();<br>2. CtClass cc = pool.get("Screen");<br>3. CtMethod cm = cc.getDeclaredMethod("draw", new CtClass[0]);<br>4. cm.insertBefore("{ System.out.println($1); System.out.println($2); }");<br>5. cc.writeFile(); </font>
</p><p>This example inserts a code fragment at the beginning of the
draw method so that the values of the two parameters to draw are
printed out. $1 and $2 are special variables representing the first and
second parameters to draw. </p><p>Special variables starting with $ are also available in the
source text passed to the setBody method in CtMethod. The following
example shows how to add a wrapper method: </p><p><font color="#800000">1. CtClass cc = sloader.get("Point");<br>2. CtMethod m1 = cc.getDeclaredMethod("move");<br>3. CtMethod m2 = CtNewMethod.copy(m1, cc, null);<br>4. m1.setName(m1.getName() + "_orig");<br>5. m2.setBody("{ System.out.println("call"); return $proceed($$);<br>}", "this", m1.getName());<br>6. cc.addMethod(m2);<br>7. cc.writeFile(); </font>
</p><p>This program first makes a copy of the move method in the Point
class, then it renames the original move method to move_ orig. It then
changes the body of the copy of the move method so the copy will be a
wrapper method named move, which prints a message and invokes the
move_orig method. The second parameter to setBody specifies the target
object of the $proceed call, and the third parameter specifies the name
of the method called by $proceed. </p><p>Javassist also has a multitude of other helper objects and
functions that allow you to do things like replace field access,
redirect method calls, and simplify how you insert code before or after
a method. Check out <a href="http://www.javassist.org/" target="new">www.javassist.org</a> for more information and tutorials. 
</p><p><strong>Performance Overhead</strong><br>Some developers
seriously care about the runtime performance of class files modified by
Javassist. However, runtime penalties due to Javassist are extremely
low, thanks to the custom compiler included in Javassist. While
handling special variables starting with $ is the major source of the
runtime penalties, the custom compiler produces optimized bytecode to
reduce the overhead. For example, developers can use the instrument
method in CtMethod to replace a method-call expression. If the
substituted block statement is equivalent to the original expression,
only a few extra machine cycles will be paid at runtime for every
method call at that expression. </p><p><strong>ClassLoader</strong><br>Javassist can be used in
conjunction with a ClassLoader to modify the bytecode of a class at
runtime before it's loaded. In Java, developers can customize the
classloading behavior by implementing a custom ClassLoader. They can
use this mechanism so that class definitions will be modified on demand
with Javassist when the classes are loaded. </p><p>The simplest way to modify and load a class at runtime is to
call the toClass method in CtClass instead of the writeFile method. In
the previous examples, the modified class files have been written out
on a disk. However, the toClass method loads the class by a custom
ClassLoader of Javassist and it returns the java.lang.Class object that
represents the loaded class. Listing 2 dynamically defines the Hello
class from scratch and adds the say() method, then it loads the Hello
class and calls that method. </p><p>The definition of the IHello interface is as follows: 
</p><p><font color="#800000">1. public interface IHello {<br>2. void say();<br>3. } </font>
</p><p><strong>Tips on ClassLoaders</strong><br>Using toClass is simple
but developers must be careful. Because of Java's classloading
algorithm, developers might be confused and run into
ClassCastExceptions. For example, in Listing 2, let's load the IHello
interface with the toClass method before loading the Hello class,
resulting in: </p><p><font color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :<br>7. Class ih = ci.toClass();<br>8. Class h = cc.toClass();<br>9. IHello obj = (IHello)h.newInstance();<br>10. obj.say(); </font>
</p><p>This change makes the cast operation at line 9 throw a
ClassCastException, since the IHello interface appearing in the
definition of the Hello class is different from the IHello interface at
line 9. </p><p>To understand this situation, you must know that multiple
ClassLoaders can coexist in Java and they form a tree structure. Each
ClassLoader except the root has a parent ClassLoader, which normally
loads the class of that child ClassLoader. The request to load a class
is delegated along this hierarchy of ClassLoaders. </p><p>If a class file is loaded by two distinct ClassLoaders, it
becomes two distinct classes with the same name and definition. Since
the two classes are not identical, an instance of one class is not
assignable to a variable of the other class. In the previous example,
IHello is loaded at line 7 by a custom ClassLoader of Javassist (let's
call it LJ). Since the loaded classes and interfaces are cached in the
ClassLoader, the IHello interface loaded by LJ is used as the interface
implemented by the Hello class when it's loaded by LJ at line 8. </p><p>On the other hand, IHello at line 9 represents the interface
that's loaded by a ClassLoader that loads the class including line 9
(let's call it LP). Since this ClassLoader LP also loads the class of
LJ, it's the parent ClassLoader of LJ. Since the object created by
h.newInstance() has the IHello interface loaded by LJ but not LP, the
cast operation at line 9 fails and throws an exception. Note that if
line 7 were removed, LJ would delegate at line 8 to the parent
ClassLoader LP to load IHello, and thus the Hello class loaded by LJ
would implement IHello loaded by LP. Thus the cast operation at line 9
would succeed. </p><p>To avoid this ClassCastException problem, Javassist provides
another ClassLoader that allows developers to fully control the
classloading behavior. Developers can define an event listener that is
notified every time a client requests to load a class so that the
listener can properly modify the class. </p><p><strong>Summary</strong><br>Javassist is a powerful Java
library that helps provide instrumentation of bytecode at load time or
at compile time. Since it provides source-level abstraction, which is
higher than the abstraction by similar libraries, using Javassist is
relatively easy and detailed knowledge of Java bytecode is unnecessary.
