General Note on Decompiler:
-------------------------

A decompiler's role as the user is familiar with is only concerned with
is only responsible for reading the bytecodes produced the compiler.
As there are different interpretaions for the same piece of java code
it is  not always possible to reverse the bytecode to produce the
exact java File from which .class File was produced.

***************** NOTE *********************************

Also be aware that in some cases,licences prevent you the end user
from decompiling or reverse enginneering class files.

So please use with care. That said have fun and PLEASE do not

Known Bugs Or limitations
-------------------------

1> In this release ternary operations work properly when used
 in constructors.In all other cases,jdec tries to construct 
 if constructs for ternary operations.
 In this release ternary operations are not always decompiled
 properly.This feature has some bugs.(when used as arguments
 in method calls apart from constructors)



2>Right Now Annonymous Inner classes are not inlined.
JDec can decompile inner classes to any depth , BUT
it does NOT inline the class in this release. Intention
is to make it work soon.


3>Shortcut operators sometimes are not decompiled properly.
This feature was absent in previous releases.If shortcut
operator is used in ternary operartions in a new call
then jdec may not decompile the ternary opertion properly.


4>Jdec has been tested till Java version 1.4.2_11 version
In all probability it should work fine for any 1.4 Java
Release
